# hobby
   Project made in the course Work Methology for programmers at MedieInstitutet February 2023.

 Using TypeScript, focusing on keyboard accessibility, 
      where you can tab between the images in the gallery view, 
      and open/close the popup modals using the keyboards enter and esc key.<br>
      Played around with tabindex to create a flow FROM GALLERY VIEW TO POP UP MODAL.<br>
      Fun little project and learned a lot!<br><br>
